BELMOPAN, Belize – Belize has reiterated its diplomatic support for Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, even as its neighbor, Nicaragua, has switched its support for Beijing. Prime Minister John Briceno and Taiwanese ambassador David Kuan-Chou Chien (File Photo)Prime Minister John Briceño in a statement posted on his Twitter account said that Belmopan would continue its support for Taiwan, which has diplomatic relations with a less than handful of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and St. Kitts-Nevis. Beijing has told countries that they should accept its “One China Policy”  should they want to develop diplomatic relations with the Asian country. Taiwan had expressed “heartfelt pain and regret” over Nicaragua’s decision, accusing the government of disregarding a “longstanding and close friendship” between the two countries. “We recognize Taiwan for its continued bilateral support to Belize. This recent collaboration will contribute to ongoing infrastructure development projects and the construction of a new government building in the Lake Independence Area of Belize City,” Briceño wrote. Belize and Taiwan have established diplomatic relations since 1989.
