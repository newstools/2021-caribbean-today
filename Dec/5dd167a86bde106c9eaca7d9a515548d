GEORGETOWN, Guyana – The People’s National Congress Reform’s (PNCR), the main party within the coalition A Partnership for National Unity (APNU), Sunday elected Aubrey Norton as its new leader to replace former president David Granger, who did not seek re-election. Aubrey Norton (file photo)Chief Election Officer, Vincent Alexander, said Norton had defeated three other candidates, including Leader of the opposition in Parliament, Joseph Harmon, who is poised to retain his position in the Parliament. Harmon Sunday publicly conceded that he had been defeated by Norton, who polled 967 votes as against 245 for Harmon and 64 for Vanwest Charles. Alexander said 1,282 persons cast votes at Saturday’s elections under a delegate system and dismissed suggestions that the prolonged delay in announcing the results had anything to do with internal negotiations. “I want to disabuse the public of any such thought and to distance myself from any such kind of involvement. The results I bring tp you are the results of the election after the count and do not in any way involve any intervention with anyone for any purpose,” said Alexander. He said the new leader will be installed on Monday after a declaration is made. While the tabulated results for the positions of Leader, Chairman, Vice Chairmen and Treasurer were announced, the Chief Election Officer said the results for the 15 Central Executive Committee members were not yet ready. Alexander said that the party would have to decide how to resolve the tie between Viceroy Jordan and Christopher Jones – 381 votes each- for the position of Vice Chairman although Elizabeth Niles got the most votes (470) for one of the Vice Chairmen. The PNCR’s Executive caters for two Vice Chairmen.
