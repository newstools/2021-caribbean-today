Saturday was very special for us as the completion of the fifth berth earlier this year allowed us the capacity to now be able to receive more vessels in port and seeing those five ships perched so beautifully at the cruise port was definitely a captivating sight,” said Dona Regis-Prosper, CAP general manager. “Recognizing that we are still within an active pandemic we continue to work closely with the Ministry of Health and Wellness in the execution of protocols to ensure safety of our guests, service providers and residents.   While still not back at 2019 levels, we are looking forward to a continued trajectory of growth.” She added. CAP said that next year is also very promising with more than 200 bookings so far . It said with upgrades to Heritage Quay Shopping Center to begin by the second quarter of 2022, “this development is expected to increase the retail and food and beverage footprint of Antigua Cruise Port while increasing the entertainment offerings in the destination”.
