KINGSTON, Jamaica – Minister of Health and Wellness, Dr. Christopher Tufton says training arrangements are being finalized to facilitate local testing for COVID-19 variants. The PAHO Jamaica office has been assisting the Ministry of Health and Wellness with the COVID-19 pandemic through training courses and the provision of essential equipment.

The reports I have from the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) coordinating with the Ministry’s personnel is that, in a sense, we are in a queue, but we do expect that personnel will come in, hopefully, over the next week or so for training to take place,” he added. The Minister noted that as those details are being finalized, the Ministry continues to collaborate with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), CDC and Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) to send samples for genome sequencing. For this week, the Ministry has sent some 49 samples to PAHO, 80 to CDC and 20 to CARPHA.
