Focus is also being placed on immuno-compromised individuals such as cancer patients, renal dialysis and transplant patients, persons living with HIV/AIDS and persons receiving immune-suppressive therapy. Once the vaccine program progresses, those individuals 60 years and over will be prioritized including those individuals living in long-term care facilities.
