NEW YORK, NY- The month of December is a very busy month for Caribbean Nationals the world over because December 25th – Christmas Day; December 26th – Boxing Day in England and the Caribbean region and of course December 31st – New Years Eve! All these dates are special not only for what they represent as major holidays but also for the special foods that Caribbean chefs and cooks prepare and serve to their clients, family, friends and special guests. In the Caribbean community, while a lot of fuss is made about decorating the house with new curtains, bedspreads and furniture, the emphasis is on the specially made food, drinks and desserts which are made and shared with friends and family than on gifts. Below is a recipe for traditional Caribbean sorrel that your guests will enjoy! Sorrel Drink RecipeTraditional Caribbean holiday drink, Sorrel.
