GEORGETOWN, Guyana – The Guyana government Tuesday announced a revision to the national emergency coronavirus (COVID-19) measures to allow for the Guyana/Brazil border crossing to be opened from Mondays to Fridays. The Takutu Bridge at the Guyana/Brazil borderThe Takutu Bridge had been closed for more than a year and flights between the countries were also halted as the authorities here implemented the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus as Brazil had been named as having one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in the world with several variants also circulating there. It is unclear whether flights between the two countries will resume. The new measure has already taken effect and replaces the old arrangement where persons were allowed to travel between the two countries using the crossing only on Fridays. Addressing the daily COVID-19 Update, Health Minister, Dr. Frank Anthony said the revised measures have been put in place to allow for the general movement of people and not only for business purposes. “This opening from Monday to Friday would allow for people to come across once they are able to produce their vaccination to show that they are fully vaccinated and that they have an antigen test or a PCR test that is negative,” the Health Minister said. He said the policy for persons entering Guyana at any one of the ports of entry remains this same and that the individual must present proof of vaccination or a negative PCR or antigen test. The closure of the border had sparked protest in September with Brazilians calling for the measures to be lifted. The demonstrations resulted in discussions between Guyanese and Brazilian authorities on how both countries can enable the safe movement of people and goods during the pandemic.
