MIAMI, Florida —  PortMiami recorded 1,254,064 twenty-foot equivalent units up 17.6% the busiest year in cargo activity in the Port's history for the Fiscal Year 2021, which started October 1, 2020, and ended September 30, 2021. The increase in volumes did not generate any vessel congestion or delays at the Port’s main shipping channel. PortMiami has kept the critical movement of cargo flowing despite the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Port officials attribute smooth cargo operations to solid partnerships and collaboration with the trade community, including the trucking companies and truckers, terminal operators Port of Miami Terminal Operating Company, Seaboard Marine, and South Florida Container Terminal, the International Longshoremen's Association, the warehousing community, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, and Biscayne Bay Pilots, among so many others. "PortMiami's cargo performance is a reflection of the resilience of our community and the critical role played by our seaport," said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. "Despite the incredible challenges of a global pandemic, the Port set a record for the strongest year in cargo activity in our history. Miami-Dade County is a major global hub for trade and commerce and strengthening cargo activity will help us rebuild an even stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come. We welcome more container ships to our Port, to do our part to help global trade move and grow jobs and business opportunities here in our community. PortMiami is ready!"
