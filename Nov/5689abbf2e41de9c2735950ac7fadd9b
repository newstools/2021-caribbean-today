They are followed by Jamaica, which is projected to receive USD 3.5 billion this year, a rise from 3 billion last year. Rounding out the top three is Haiti, which is set to receive USD 3.11 billion this year, the same as last year. Generally, remittance flows into the Caribbean and Latin America will likely reach a new high of $126 billion in 2021, registering a solid advance of 21.6 percent compared to 2020, the World Bank said Wednesday. Mexico, the region’s largest remittance recipient, received 42 percent ($52.7 billion) of the regional total. The value of remittances as a share of GDP exceeds 20 percent for several smaller economies: El Salvador (26.2 percent), Honduras (26.6 percent), and Guatemala (18 percent). The adverse effects of COVID-19 and Hurricanes Grace and Ida contributed to higher remittance flows to Mexico and Central America. Here’s where the other Caribbean nations stack up: Guyana – USD 393 million Trinidad and Tobago – USD 178 million Suriname – USD 170 million Belize – USD 140 million Curacao – USD 124 million Barbados – USD 108 million Dominica – USD 52 million Grenada- USD 48 million Aruba – USD 38 million St. Kitts & Nevis – USD 26 million Antigua & Barbuda – USD 25 million St. Lucia – USD 25 million Cayman Islands – USD 14 million Turks & Caicos – USD 7 million ~NewsAmericasNow.com
