Jamaican company, AMJ, has signed a five-year agreement with the National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute (NAREI) in Guyana, for processing and packaging spices and seasonings at Hope Estate, East Coast Demerara. The agreement was signed by NAREI’s chief executive officer Jagnarine Singh and AMJ chairman, Anand James, in the presence of Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture Madanlall Ramraj and NAREI chairman, retired Major General Joseph Singh. The agreement allows for AMJ to use NAREI’s agro-processing facility at Hope Estate and Ramraj lauded the efforts of the two entities in taking agro-processing and value-added to a next level in an effort to improve the viability of the local agro-processing industry. “In excess of GUY$800 million (One Guyana dollar=US$0.004 cents) have been earmarked for the establishment of six agro-processing facilities across the country, as the development of the industry remains a top priority of the Government of Guyana and by extension the Ministry of Agriculture,” Ramraj said. He said that it is imperative that the condiments produced remain at a high standard and to the satisfaction of the household. Earlier this year, Agriculture Minister Zulfikar Mustapha announced the development of a robust market strategy which will cater for farmers and agro-processors to be linked to lucrative markets both locally and internationally.
