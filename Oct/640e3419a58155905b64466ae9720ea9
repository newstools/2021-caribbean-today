MIAMI GARDENS, Florida – South Florida Motorsports (SFM), the organizers of the Formula 1® Miami Grand Prix, have announced a series of initiatives designed to drive youth education and business development in Miami Gardens. SFM recently launched the F1 in Schools program at the City of Miami Gardens’ Bunche Park STEM Center and will host a Business Summit for Miami Gardens restaurants at Hard Rock Stadium on November 16, 2021. The first ever F1 Miami Grand Prix will be held on May 6-8, 2022. “From the start, we believed the success of the F1 Miami Grand Prix would be connected to the value we create for our community,” said Tom Garfinkel, Managing Partner, F1 Miami Grand Prix. “These intentional efforts reflect that belief, and we are proud to work with the City of Miami Gardens to provide STEM programming for area youth and support minority-owned businesses.” Created in 2000, F1 in Schools is dedicated to introducing students to design, engineering, project management, branding, marketing, and teamwork using the excitement and appeal of Formula 1®. With competitions taking place in 54 countries across the world, and opportunities within all the US and Canada, F1 in Schools is one of the largest global educational programs that raise awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) among students and school children. The F1 in Schools program will be administered through the Miami Gardens Parks and Recreation Department for students from 6-17 years of age. “Not only is it exciting to welcome an international sporting event like Formula 1 to Miami Gardens, it is also rewarding to have partners who are committed to investing in our community and youth. In addition to the economic boost for local businesses, the educational opportunities for the students and kids in our parks’ programs will be extremely valuable,” said Miami Gardens Mayor Rodney Harris. “These initiatives align with the City’s overall goal of creating meaningful, sustainable programs for residents and businesses.” The Business Summit will be a unique opportunity for Miami Gardens restaurants to learn about how to get involved in the F1 Miami Grand Prix, a global event that will bring economic impact and unparalleled fan experiences. Miami Gardens restaurants will have the ability to network, ask questions and showcase their business in advance of the event. “Hard Rock Stadium has been committed to the success of restaurants in Miami Gardens since the start of the pandemic and it is impressive that this commitment will continue through F1 Miami Grand Prix by including minority owned restaurants in this major event,” said Rolanda Benjamin, Owner of Lovely’s Restaurant in Miami Gardens. “It is important for restaurants to attend the business summit because there is a major difference between selling your food outdoors at a sporting event versus from your restaurant kitchen. Learning how to adapt our business operations to be successful in this format is extremely important not only for our economic growth but our community growth as well. I appreciate Hard Rock Stadium for staying committed to the prosperity of Miami Gardens and its businesses.” Interested parties for the F1 in Schools program and Business Summit for Miami Gardens restaurants can register at community@f1miamigp.com
