We had several meetings with several functionaries. We met with Funatur, who is the group in charge of developing the Tren Maya project that connects entire south and southwest of Mexico,” Briceno said. The Tren Maya is a 1,525km-long railway project that will interconnect the major cities and tourist regions of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Also known as the Mayan Train Project, it will significantly improve transportation and economic growth in the country. The railway project, which is led by Mexico’s National Fund for the Promotion of Tourism (Fonatur), will include seven separate sections, with Fonatur committed to complete the first section of the intercity railway project by 2023. Briceno said that Belize intends to “link up with Tren Maya...more sooner hopefully than later” and that the discussions with the authorities in Mexico , involved “how at the moment to bring at least the range to end at the border where we can put the modern facilities for tourists to off load, and again goods that we can bring to the country. “We also discussed a very interesting concept. How is it that we can connect San Pedro to Cancun, which is called the Rivera Maya, which is a canal that separates the island of Ambergris Caye from Mexico. So once, you can connect them, you can get in your car from San Pedro drive all the way to Cancun, or from Cancun drive all the way to San Pedro,” Briceno said.
